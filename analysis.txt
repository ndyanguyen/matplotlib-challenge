According to the data, the top two drugs that were best for the mice were Capomulin and Ramicane. Infuibnol was a lower outlier  compared to the other drugs.

Also according to the data, it seems that propriva had the least usage compared to all the other drugs.

My last observation is that the weight of mice contributes heavily to the volume of the tumors. If we look at the line plot, we see a connection between the weight and volume.
